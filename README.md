[![Clippy Linting Result](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/barometz/timexif/master/badge.svg)]

Timexif wants to be a small, almost single-purpose tool: to take a box of JPEG images with EXIF timestamps and turn them into a time-lapse GIF or video with appropriate frame timing based on the timestamps.

This is my first project in Rust, so .. give it some time.
